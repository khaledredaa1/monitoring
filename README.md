## Description ##
Building Prometheus and Grafana Monitoring System.

## Purpose ##
- Collect metrics from various sources.
- Create custom dashboards.
- Set up alerts for monitoring your infrastructure and applications.

## Tools and Technologies ##
- Prometheus: an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- Grafana: a visualization tool commonly used for monitoring dashboards.
- Exporters (Node Exporter, cAdvisor, etc.)
- Alertmanager (optional)
- Docker
- Kubernetes (optional)

## Project Setup Environment ##
- Set up a virtual machine or cloud instance to host Prometheus and Grafana. Alternatively, you can use Docker containers for local development or testing. Ensure that the environment has sufficient resources to run Prometheus and Grafana smoothly.
- Install Prometheus: Download and install Prometheus on the designated host.
- Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from desired targets using YAML configuration files.
- Install and Configure Exporters: Install exporters such as Node Exporter, cAdvisor, or others on the systems you want to monitor.
- Configure exporters to expose metrics in the Prometheus exposition format. Ensure that exporters are accessible from the Prometheus server.
- Configure Grafana: Download and install Grafana on the designated host.
- Access the Grafana web interface and configure data sources. Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana using its HTTP API URL. 
- Create Monitoring Dashboards: Use Grafana's dashboard editor to create custom dashboards. Add panels to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus and exported by exporters. Design informative dashboards for monitoring system performance, resource utilization, and application metrics.
- Set Up Alerts (Optional): Install and configure Alertmanager if you want to set up alerts based on certain conditions.
- Define alerting rules in Prometheus configuration files to trigger alerts.
- Configure Alertmanager to send alerts via email, Slack, or other notification channels.
- Integrate with Kubernetes (Optional): If using Kubernetes, install Prometheus and Grafana using Helm charts.
- Configure Prometheus to discover and monitor Kubernetes services, pods, and nodes. Create Grafana dashboards specifically designed for monitoring Kubernetes clusters.
- Testing and Validation: Test the monitoring system by generating load or triggering specific events in your infrastructure.
- Verify that Prometheus collects metrics as expected and Grafana visualizes them accurately.
- Documentation: Document the setup and configuration steps for Prometheus and Grafana. Write a guide or tutorial on building a monitoring system with Prometheus and Grafana, including best practices and tips.
